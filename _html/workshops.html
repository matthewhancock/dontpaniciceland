Beginning January 2014, we are very excited to announce our partnership with Labrador Iceland, a unique and exhilarating new way to experience Iceland!<br /><br />
Labrador specializes in a full range of adventures - from week-long photo expeditions into Europe‘s largest national park, Vatnajökull, on the South coast of Iceland, as well as breathtaking northern lights photography seminars, and videography workshops to incredible destinations all over the country.<br /><br />
Labrador photography and videography workshops are a rapidly growing service. Vogue, Volkswagen, Mercedes Benz, Samsung, Heineken, Audi, and Procter & Gamble are just a few to have chosen Labrador's professional production services for one main reason: Iceland is simply magical, and offers unique opportunities for photoshoots, filming locations, and projects.<br /><br />
Interested in booking a personalized photography or videography workshop in Iceland with Don’t Panic Films head director and National Geographic photographer, Bowen Staines? Head over to <a href="http://labrador.is" target="_blank">Labrador.is</a> for more information and a complete listing of 2014 workshops. Each week-long seminar is carefully tailored specifically to each participant, and spots are extremely limited.<br /><br />
<blockquote>
    "Each day, participants will be given a list of objectives or "missions" for each location, specifically tailored to their personal levels of experience. This will allow individuals to branch off and exorcize their creativity on their own, while still actively engaging in group activities. There will also be comprehensive and in-depth discussions about the history of each location, its significance to Icelandic culture, as well as folklore and myths surrounding the specific area. It is my hope that each individual leaves my workshops with not only a better understanding of photography and cinematography, but of Iceland and Icelandic culture and music, as a whole."&emsp;-Bowen Staines
