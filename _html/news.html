AUGUST 3rd, 2015 - Welcome to French Canada! Would you like a mustache?!

Built for the 1976 Summer Olympics, this tunnel was originally used for the passage of athletes, and has now become one of the most prestigious structures in skateboarding. Got about as high as I could get on this wallride without bashing my head into the ceiling, just before some heavy thunder clouds rolled in.

JUNE 22nd, 2015 - Today, we’re in Halifax, Nova Scotia doing survival training! <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101043090715037&set=pcb.10101043091024417&type=1&theater" target="_blank">In Day 1 of Survival Systems, we experienced what it feels like to crash a helicopter upside-down and have it rapidly sink into the ocean</a>, in the middle of a storm, in the dark.
<br /><br />
MAY 17th, 2015 - We recently caught up with Wim Van Hooste at ROK/Icelandic Music Review, to discuss everything from upcoming projects and what first brought us to Iceland, to the evolution of music video editing and where the name "Don't Panic" came from (it's not a Hitchhikers Guide reference). <a href="http://rokmusik.co/i-love-icelandic-music-because-i-dont-panic/" target="_blank">Check it out</a>!

Much love to you all, and please enjoy the video!

Ryan and I have been working on a double skate part over the last few years, about the two of us riding (or attempting to ride) unusual or unreal obstacles; this project will eventually take us from glaciers and the fuselage of a crashed plane, to the radioactive apartment blocks of Chernobyl. It will be a while before this video is done, but it should be worth the wait.
<br /><br />
NOVEMBER 19th, 2014 - Iceland Airwaves 2014 was definitely a standout year for us; this was our ninth time attending Airwaves, and there hasn’t been such a memorable festival since maybe 2009. The energy was as incredible and varied as the lineup, which made the impending week of morning tinnitus and bodily destruction seem oddly welcome. It’s only been a week since the festival ended, but we're more than ready to do it all again. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/dontpanicfilms/media_set?set=a.10100823527780917.1073741841.39603408&type=1" target="_blank">Check out the full album of Airwaves photography here!</a>

OCTOBER 23rd, 2014 - We just released a short parody of Agent Fresco's brilliant 'Dark Water' video, which they released earlier this Summer. Entitled 'Dirt Water', we shot this parody in the Westfjörds of Iceland, without any of the guys knowing! <a href="http://www.visir.is/gera-grin-ad-tonlistarmyndbandi-i-drullusvadi/article/2014141029499" target="_blank">Check it out here</a>, and don't miss Agent Fresco at this year's Iceland Airwaves Music Festival!

<br /><br />
JULY 27th, 2014 - We officially have Picture Lock on the new Sólstafir video. We rented an entire fjord near the town of Hólmavík in the Icelandic Westfjörds, and shot the entire video over the course of two exhausting twenty-hour days. We are extremely happy with how the video is coming together, and you won't have to wait very long to see it! The whole thing will be released in just a few short weeks. Check out some behind-the-scenes photos <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100716413793207&set=a.640489552037.2205313.39603408&type=1&theater" target="_blank">HERE</a>: I'm pretty sure this is the most beautiful place I've ever transferred an SD card...

JULY 25th, 2014 - Shooting began today for the new Sólstafir music video! <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100711052237807&set=pcb.10100711053340597&type=1&theater" target="_blank">Here's a sneak peek</a> at a few of the locations, located in Iceland's Westfjörds.
<br /><br />
JULY 13th, 2014 - Left Costa Rica today, and flew 16 hours to Paris, France. Our crew was insanely jetlagged, but still found the energy to film a short skate edit on the streets near the Bastille. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10100703901567807" target="_blank">Check it out HERE</a>!
<br /><br />

<br /><br />
JULY 5th, 2014 - In Costa Rica filming a commercial for a French cosmetics company. After an earthquake strong enough to knock the TV in my hotel room off the table, I decided it would be a smart idea to hike up the largest active volcano in the country, Arenal. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100697229403877&set=a.587624094837.2154158.39603408&type=1&theater" target="_blank">I got extremely sunburned, and saw a snake larger than I felt comfortable seeing</a>.
<br /><br />
JULY 1st, 2014 - I've been working on this song "Ghosts of The Radio" since roughly the beginning of March. Although the melody is upbeat and poppy, the message is slightly more bitter and worrisome. Somewhat of a comment on certain aspects of the modern music industry, the song considers themes of mortality, anxiety, claustrophobia, urgency, and nostalgia. I recorded the whole thing live in our spare bedroom with a mess of different software and odd devices, ranging from an iPhone 5 to a 1st gen BOSS BR-8 analog studio, and mastered/mixed it entirely in Final Cut Pro. <a href="http://vimeo.com/97244171" target="_blank">Listen to "Ghosts of The Radio" HERE</a>!
<br /><br />
JUNE 30th, 2014 - If there ever were a beautiful, historic, unique, and truly terrifying spot, it'd be the Auburn fullpipe. Located at the bottom of a 100-foot storm drain, the Auburn pipe has hosted countless memorable sessions over its half-century run. Now, it sits here with the bottom rotting out of it, nearly forgotten. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10100692303540347&set=vb.39603408&type=2&theater" target="_blank">Check out this very short teaser</a> I threw together yesterday of some of the footage from our session on Saturday. We'll be working on a more comprehensive, full-length clip this month, so keep checking back! Featuring brand new music by SÓLSTAFIR.
<br /><br />
APRIL 24th, 2014 – We just finished a new teaser trailer for the brilliant Icelandic math rockers, Agent Fresco. They’ve got a brand new single coming out soon called “Dark Water”, and it’s pretty darn nifty. <a href="https://vimeo.com/92977294" target="_blank">Watch the trailer HERE</a>!

APRIL 1st, 2014 - Our video for Skálmöld's "Gleipnir" just won Music Video of the Year.

We are very, very thankful, and definitely don't take this for granted. <a href="https://vimeo.com/72111113" target="_blank">Watch “Gleipnir” HERE</a>!
<br /><br />
MARCH 28th, 2014 – We have been working on a lot of new music recently, gradually amassing new material for a full-length album. This new track is a demo called “Wicked Skin”, an experimental hybrid of 80’s lo-fi synth-pop, and traditional mountain folk rock. It’s an unpleasant story of addiction, and the many forms it can take. <a href="https://vimeo.com/89118161" target="_blank">Listen to “Wicked Skin” HERE</a>!

FEBRUARY 17th, 2014 - We are very excited to announce our new partnership with Labrador Iceland, where we're now offering customizable, week-long photo & video workshops in the heart of the Icelandic nature.

    NOVEMBER 29th, 2013 - Skálmöld performed the first of three shows with the Icelandic Symphony Orchestra <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100506790125717&set=a.653314306127.2224983.39603408&type=3&theater" target="_blank">last night at Harpa</a>, and as expected, the evening went so far above and beyond anything we've witnessed at a live show.

    JULY 7th, 2013 - The Auburn full pipe is a well-kept secret amongst east coast skateboarders, and has been the host to many memorable sessions since the 1970's. It's basically a gigantic storm drain, and it's so steep that you have to repel into it - the bottom leaks badly and is full of turtles, and coyotes have been regularly know to walk right through the middle of your session. Needless to say, we needed to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/dontpanicfilms/media_set?set=a.10100376953469417.1073741825.39603408&type=3" target="_blank">check it out</a>!

    MARCH 9th, 2013 - Back to Reykjavík still in one piece after eight days on the road with Skálmöld.

    <br /><br />
    MARCH 8th, 2013 - Tonight on the Skálmöld tour, we'll be playing at Litla Hraun ("Little Lava"), Iceland's maximum security prison, Folsom Prison-style!

Between two buses, we've gone through (not on purpose) two transmissions, one starter, one shifter knob, the passenger-side glovebox, and both the back doors don't open anymore.
    <br /><br />
    MARCH 5th, 2013 - While driving through completely white-out conditions en route to Höfn, we nearly power-slid our tour bus into a heard of 25-30 reindeer. I've never seen a reindeer before, and I'm greatly relieved I'm not responsible for accidentally murdering any.
    <br /><br />
    MARCH 4th, 2013 - In Skálmöld's hometown of Húsavík, in the northeast of Iceland. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100283306388917&set=t.39603408&type=3&theater" target="_blank">As you can see, we've getting some pretty intense weather the last few days</a>. If you don't speak Icelandic, the name of the tour translates to "Darkness, Cold, Ice, and Snow". Believe us, the irony isn't lost on us.

    MARCH 3rd, 2013 - In Akureyri in the north of Iceland, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=114431302076361&set=t.39603408&type=3&theater" target="_blank">doing some filming underneath a hidden waterfall for Skálmöld's 'Gleipnir' video</a>.

    JANUARY 6th, 2012 – We are saddened to hear that NASA, one of Reykjavik’s oldest and most established venues, will soon be no more. Downtown 101 was the last place on earth that needed ANOTHER hotel. We’ve had many unforgettable moments at NASA, gone to countless shows, stared drunkenly into those sand-blasted plate glass lobsters, and broken more bottles of beer upon that shiny black floor than we’d care to admit. Hopefully something will change before Reykjavik becomes one enormous hotel. Read the article <a href="http://www.visir.is/nasa-verdi-rifid-1.-juni/article/2012120109360" target="_blank">here</a>.
