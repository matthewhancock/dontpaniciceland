    <h2 class="f16">‘WHERE’S THE SNOW?!’ (2011) Feature Film</h2>
    <span class="b">Genre:</span> Documentary<br />
    <span class="b">Runtime:</span> 54 min.<br />
    <span class="b">Summary:</span> Since the first show held in 1999 (in an airplane hangar), Iceland Airwaves has become one of the premier showcases for new music - Icelandic and otherwise - in the world. It's been called "the most innovative music festival since CMJ" and is "as responsible for all of Reykjavik's positive press as Bjork herself"... Some of the world's most exciting artists - including Suede, The Flaming Lips, The Hives, Fatboy Slim, Robyn, Thievery Corporation, Bloc Party, and Casio Kids - have made the short hop from Europe or North America to share the stages with Iceland's finest talents: Sigur Ros, Of Monsters and Men, Olafur Arnalds, Gus Gus, Agent Fresco, Minus, Mugison, Jaguar, Dikta, Quarashi, Leaves, Trabant, FM Belfast, Steed Lord and many, MANY more. And when the live bands are finished, top DJs spin across the city until dawn... "Where's The Snow?!" is a meticulous and visually-stunning look at 14 of Iceland's top artists and groups, and the thunderous - yet very intimate - music that has earned this country its reputation as one of the most artistically endowed societies on the globe.
